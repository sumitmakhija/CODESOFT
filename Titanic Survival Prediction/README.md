# Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

Welcome to Task 1 of my Data Science Internship. In this task, I embarked on predicting the survival outcomes of passengers aboard the Titanic. 

## Overview

The Titanic dataset is one of the most famous datasets in the realm of data science and machine learning. It provides information about passengers and their survival status. The challenge is to predict this survival status based on various attributes like age, gender, class, fare, etc.

## Notebook Contents:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: The dataset is loaded into the environment, and preliminary explorations are conducted to understand its structure and attributes.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing is an essential step to ensure that the dataset is clean and ready for modeling. This section involves handling missing values, feature engineering, and more.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Post data preprocessing, a predictive model is trained. The model's performance is then evaluated using appropriate metrics.
