## Introduction

The Iris dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species. The three classes in the Iris dataset are:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolour
- Iris-virginica

## Data Exploration and Visualization

In this section, we explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distribution. Various visualizations are employed to get insights from the data.

## Data Preprocessing

Before feeding the data to our model, necessary preprocessing steps such as normalization, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables are performed.

## Model Building

A suitable machine learning model is chosen and trained using the processed data.

## Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using appropriate metrics to determine its accuracy and reliability.

## Conclusion

Summary of the findings, model performance, and potential improvements for future iterations.
